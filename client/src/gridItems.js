              <h2>Why was this built?</h2>
              <p>This is a small web app created to show off the progression of a to be training piercer</p>
              <p>This site aims to allow for easy upload of the required images and details of a given piercing to showcase how it was approached and show off the end result.</p>

              <h2>Why were the chosen technologies used</h2>
              <h3>Django  (Python)</h3>
              <p>We as a team chose Laravel as a framework as the current development team at create were already working on a php based website so we found it fitting to modernise the site in a way where no potentially new language would be needed to be learned as a current dev. we also agreed that using a backend framework instead of a from scratch php one would allow for easier uprading in the future by new developers</p>

              <h2>Why was this built?</h2>

              <h3>React (NodeJS)</h3>
              <p>As the previous site was around 15 years old we decided to moderise it by using a front end framework to bring the site into a more modern standard and to easier upgrade or change parts(components) of the site without having to look at a massive codebase all at once.</p>
